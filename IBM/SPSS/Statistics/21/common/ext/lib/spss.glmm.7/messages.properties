kGLMM_DuplicatedRepeatedLevels.LABEL=The levels of the repeated measures effect are not different for each case within a repeated subject.

kGLMM_InvalidInitialValue.LABEL=Error: The initial values list or file contains invalid or insufficient data. Initial values must be supplied for all parameters (including redundant parameters if the model is generalized linear model). The ordering of the initial values should correspond to the ordering of the model parameters used by the procedure.
kGLMM_IterationTerminatedButNoConv.LABEL=The iteration was terminated but convergence has not been achieved. Output for the last iteration is displayed. The procedure continues despite this warning. Subsequent results produced are based on the last iteration. Validity of the model fit is uncertain.

kGLMM_InvalidCaseInLastIteration.LABEL=There is at least one invalid record in the last iteration. A record is invalid if there are errors in computing the inverse {0} link function, the log-likelihood, the gradient, or the Hessian matrix in the iterative process. No output will be displayed.

kGLMM_ConstantTarget.LABEL=The target must have at least two distinct valid data values when the multinomial distribution is used.
kGLMM_ResGroupingWhileNoRepMeasure.LABEL=No repeated measures field was specified, so no repeated measures part of the model was built.
kGLMM_EMMeansHasContinuousFieldInEffect.LABEL=All estimated marginal means terms must be categorical fields.
kGLMM_EMMeansEffectIsMoreThan3Ways.LABEL=No more than three fields can be specified in a single estimated marginal means term.

kGLMM_MaxIterReachedButNotConv.LABEL=The maximum number of iterations was reached but convergence was not achieved. Output for the last iteration is displayed. The procedure continues despite this warning. Subsequent results produced are based on the last iteration. Validity of the model fit is uncertain.
kGLMM_GMatrIsNotPositive.LABEL=The estimated covariance matrix of the random effects (the G matrix) is not positive definite. The procedure continues despite this warning. Subsequent results produced are based on the last iteration. Validity of the model fit is uncertain.
kGLMM_CompleteSeparation4BinomialAndNominal.LABEL=There may be a complete separation in the data. The maximum likelihood estimates do not exist. The procedure continues despite this warning. Subsequent results produced are based on the last iteration. Validity of the model fit is uncertain.
kGLMM_RecordsFoundWithNonPositiveAnalysisWeightValue.LABEL=Analysis weight data values must be positive.
kGLMM_InvalidOrMissingRecordsAreFiltered.LABEL=One or more records are not used in the analysis because they have one or more fields with invalid or missing values.
kGLMM_InvalidEventTrialsRecordsAreFiltered.LABEL=Valid values for events (target) and trials variables are non-negative and positive integers respectively, and the number of trials cannot be less than the number of events.
