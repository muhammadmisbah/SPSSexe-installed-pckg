copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
(an example is provided in the Appendix below).
"Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
"Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to

"Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
subsequently incorporated within the Work.
2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,

copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
(except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
as of the date such litigation is filed.
4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
meet the following conditions:
(a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
(b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
stating that You changed the files; and

of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
as modifying the License.
You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
the conditions stated in this License.
5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the

unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

In addition, we ask that the headers remain intact in our source code. As long as 
these guidelines are kept, we expect to continue enhancing this system and expect to
make other tools available as they are completed.

THE WORK (AS DEFINED BELOW) IS PROVIDED UNDER THE TERMS OF THIS CREATIVE COMMONS PUBLIC
LICENSE ("CCPL" OR "LICENSE"). THE WORK IS PROTECTED BY COPYRIGHT AND/OR OTHER APPLICABLE
LAW. ANY USE OF THE WORK OTHER THAN AS AUTHORIZED UNDER THIS LICENSE OR COPYRIGHT LAW IS
PROHIBITED.
BY EXERCISING ANY RIGHTS TO THE WORK PROVIDED HERE, YOU ACCEPT AND AGREE TO BE BOUND BY THE
TERMS OF THIS LICENSE. TO THE EXTENT THIS LICENSE MAY BE CONSIDERED TO BE A CONTRACT, THE
LICENSOR GRANTS YOU THE RIGHTS CONTAINED HERE IN CONSIDERATION OF YOUR ACCEPTANCE OF SUCH
TERMS AND CONDITIONS.
1. Definitions
a. "Adaptation" means a work based upon the Work, or upon the Work and other pre-existing
works, such as a translation, adaptation, derivative work, arrangement of music or other
alterations of a literary or artistic work, or phonogram or performance and includes
cinematographic adaptations or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed,
or adapted including in any form recognizably derived from the original, except that a work
that constitutes a Collection will not be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this
License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a musical work, performance or
phonogram, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation with a moving image
("synching") will be considered an Adaptation for the purpose of this License.
b. "Collection" means a collection of literary or artistic works, such as encyclopedias and
anthologies, or performances, phonograms or broadcasts, or other works or subject matter
other than works listed in Section 1(f) below, which, by reason of the selection and
arrangement of their contents, constitute intellectual creations, in which the Work is
included in its entirety in unmodified form along with one or more other contributions,
each constituting separate and independent works in themselves, which together are
assembled into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collection will not be
considered an Adaptation (as defined above) for the purposes of this License.
c. "Distribute" means to make available to the public the original and copies of the Work
or Adaptation, as appropriate, through sale or other transfer of ownership.
d. "Licensor" means the individual, individuals, entity or entities that offer(s) the Work
under the terms of this License.
e. "Original Author" means, in the case of a literary or artistic work, the individual,
individuals, entity or entities who created the Work or if no individual or entity can be
identified, the publisher; and in addition (i) in the case of a performance the actors,
singers, musicians, dancers, and other persons who act, sing, deliver, declaim, play in,
interpret or otherwise perform literary or artistic works or expressions of folklore; (ii)
in the case of a phonogram the producer being the person or legal entity who first fixes
the sounds of a performance or other sounds; and, (iii) in the case of broadcasts, the
organization that transmits the broadcast.
f. "Work" means the literary and/or artistic work offered under the terms of this License
including without limitation any production in the literary, scientific and artistic
domain, whatever may be the mode or form of its expression including digital form, such as
a book, pamphlet and other writing; a lecture, address, sermon or other work of the same
nature; a dramatic or dramatico-musical work; a choreographic work or entertainment in dumb
show; a musical composition with or without words; a cinematographic work to which are
assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to cinematography; a work of drawing,
painting, architecture, sculpture, engraving or lithography; a photographic work to which
are assimilated works expressed by a process analogous to photography; a work of applied
art; an illustration, map, plan, sketch or three-dimensional work relative to geography,
topography, architecture or science; a performance; a broadcast; a phonogram; a compilation
of data to the extent it is protected as a copyrightable work; or a work performed by a
variety or circus performer to the extent it is not otherwise considered a literary or
artistic work.
g. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not
previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has received
express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License despite a
previous violation.
h. "Publicly Perform" means to perform public recitations of the Work and to communicate to
the public those public recitations, by any means or process, including by wire or wireless
means or public digital performances; to make available to the public Works in such a way
that members of the public may access these Works from a place and at a place individually
chosen by them; to perform the Work to the public by any means or process and the
communication to the public of the performances of the Work, including by public digital
performance; to broadcast and rebroadcast the Work by any means including signs, sounds or
images.
i. "Reproduce" means to make copies of the Work by any means including without limitation
by sound or visual recordings and the right of fixation and reproducing fixations of the
Work, including storage of a protected performance or phonogram in digital form or other
electronic medium.
2. Fair Dealing Rights. Nothing in this License is intended to reduce, limit, or restrict
any uses free from copyright or rights arising from limitations or exceptions that are
provided for in connection with the copyright protection under copyright law or other
applicable laws.
3. License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this License, Licensor hereby
grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual (for the duration of the
applicable copyright) license to exercise the rights in the Work as stated below:
a. to Reproduce the Work, to incorporate the Work into one or more Collections, and to
Reproduce the Work as incorporated in the Collections;
b. to create and Reproduce Adaptations provided that any such Adaptation, including any
translation in any medium, takes reasonable steps to clearly label, demarcate or otherwise
identify that changes were made to the original Work. For example, a translation could be
marked "The original work was translated from English to Spanish," or a modification could
indicate "The original work has been modified.";
c. to Distribute and Publicly Perform the Work including as incorporated in Collections;
and,
d. to Distribute and Publicly Perform Adaptations.
e. For the avoidance of doubt:
i. Non-waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to
collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme cannot be waived,
the Licensor reserves the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You
of the rights granted under this License;
ii. Waivable Compulsory License Schemes. In those jurisdictions in which the right to
collect royalties through any statutory or compulsory licensing scheme can be waived, the
Licensor waives the exclusive right to collect such royalties for any exercise by You of
the rights granted under this License; and,
iii. Voluntary License Schemes. The Licensor waives the right to collect royalties, whether
individually or, in the event that the Licensor is a member of a collecting society that
administers voluntary licensing schemes, via that society, from any exercise by You of the
rights granted under this License.
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter
devised. The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically
necessary to exercise the rights in other media and formats. Subject to Section 8(f), all
rights not expressly granted by Licensor are hereby reserved.
4. Restrictions. The license granted in Section 3 above is expressly made subject to and
limited by the following restrictions:
a. You may Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work only under the terms of this License.
You must include a copy of, or the Uniform Resource Identifier (URI) for, this License with
every copy of the Work You Distribute or Publicly Perform. You may not offer or impose any
terms on the Work that restrict the terms of this License or the ability of the recipient
of the Work to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of the
License. You may not sublicense the Work. You must keep intact all notices that refer to
this License and to the disclaimer of warranties with every copy of the Work You Distribute
or Publicly Perform. When You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work, You may not impose
any effective technological measures on the Work that restrict the ability of a recipient
of the Work from You to exercise the rights granted to that recipient under the terms of
the License. This Section 4(a) applies to the Work as incorporated in a Collection, but
this does not require the Collection apart from the Work itself to be made subject to the
terms of this License. If You create a Collection, upon notice from any Licensor You must,
to the extent practicable, remove from the Collection any credit as required by Section
4(b), as requested. If You create an Adaptation, upon notice from any Licensor You must, to
the extent practicable, remove from the Adaptation any credit as required by Section 4(b),
as requested.
b. If You Distribute, or Publicly Perform the Work or any Adaptations or Collections, You
must, unless a request has been made pursuant to Section 4(a), keep intact all copyright
notices for the Work and provide, reasonable to the medium or means You are utilizing: (i)
the name of the Original Author (or pseudonym, if applicable) if supplied, and/or if the
Original Author and/or Licensor designate another party or parties (e.g., a sponsor
institute, publishing entity, journal) for attribution ("Attribution Parties") in
Licensor's copyright notice, terms of service or by other reasonable means, the name of
such party or parties; (ii) the title of the Work if supplied; (iii) to the extent
reasonably practicable, the URI, if any, that Licensor specifies to be associated with the
Work, unless such URI does not refer to the copyright notice or licensing information for
the Work; and (iv) , consistent with Section 3(b), in the case of an Adaptation, a credit
identifying the use of the Work in the Adaptation (e.g., "French translation of the Work by
Original Author," or "Screenplay based on original Work by Original Author"). The credit
required by this Section 4 (b) may be implemented in any reasonable manner; provided,
however, that in the case of a Adaptation or Collection, at a minimum such credit will
appear, if a credit for all contributing authors of the Adaptation or Collection appears,
then as part of these credits and in a manner at least as prominent as the credits for the
other contributing authors. For the avoidance of doubt, You may only use the credit
required by this Section for the purpose of attribution in the manner set out above and, by
exercising Your rights under this License, You may not implicitly or explicitly assert or
imply any connection with, sponsorship or endorsement by the Original Author, Licensor
and/or Attribution Parties, as appropriate, of You or Your use of the Work, without the
separate, express prior written permission of the Original Author, Licensor and/or
Attribution Parties.
c. Except as otherwise agreed in writing by the Licensor or as may be otherwise permitted
by applicable law, if You Reproduce, Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work either by
itself or as part of any Adaptations or Collections, You must not distort, mutilate, modify
or take other derogatory action in relation to the Work which would be prejudicial to the
Original Author's honor or reputation. Licensor agrees that in those jurisdictions (e.g.
Japan), in which any exercise of the right granted in Section 3(b) of this License (the
right to make Adaptations) would be deemed to be a distortion, mutilation, modification or
other derogatory action prejudicial to the Original Author's honor and reputation, the
Licensor will waive or not assert, as appropriate, this Section, to the fullest extent
permitted by the applicable national law, to enable You to reasonably exercise Your right
under Section 3(b) of this License (right to make Adaptations) but not otherwise.
5. Representations, Warranties and Disclaimer
UNLESS OTHERWISE MUTUALLY AGREED TO BY THE PARTIES IN WRITING, LICENSOR OFFERS THE WORK ASIS
AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE WORK, EXPRESS,
IMPLIED, STATUTORY OR OTHERWISE, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES OF TITLE,
MERCHANTIBILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR THE ABSENCE OF
LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS, ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OF ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT
DISCOVERABLE. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OF IMPLIED WARRANTIES, SO SUCH
EXCLUSION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.
6. Limitation on Liability. EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW, IN NO EVENT
WILL LICENSOR BE LIABLE TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL,
CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR EXEMPLARY DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS LICENSE OR THE USE OF THE
WORK, EVEN IF LICENSOR HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
7. Termination
a. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically upon any
breach by You of the terms of this License. Individuals or entities who have received
Adaptations or Collections from You under this License, however, will not have their
licenses terminated provided such individuals or entities remain in full compliance with
those licenses. Sections 1, 2, 5, 6, 7, and 8 will survive any termination of this License.
b. Subject to the above terms and conditions, the license granted here is perpetual (for
the duration of the applicable copyright in the Work). Notwithstanding the above, Licensor
reserves the right to release the Work under different license terms or to stop
distributing the Work at any time; provided, however that any such election will not serve
to withdraw this License (or any other license that has been, or is required to be, granted
under the terms of this License), and this License will continue in full force and effect
unless terminated as stated above.
8. Miscellaneous
a. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform the Work or a Collection, the Licensor
offers to the recipient a license to the Work on the same terms and conditions as the
license granted to You under this License.
b. Each time You Distribute or Publicly Perform an Adaptation, Licensor offers to the
recipient a license to the original Work on the same terms and conditions as the license
granted to You under this License.
c. If any provision of this License is invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, it
shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remainder of the terms of this
License, and without further action by the parties to this agreement, such provision shall
be reformed to the minimum extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable.
d. No term or provision of this License shall be deemed waived and no breach consented to
unless such waiver or consent shall be in writing and signed by the party to be charged
with such waiver or consent.
e. This License constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the
Work licensed here. There are no understandings, agreements or representations with respect
to the Work not specified here. Licensor shall not be bound by any additional provisions
that may appear in any communication from You. This License may not be modified without the
mutual written agreement of the Licensor and You.
f. The rights granted under, and the subject matter referenced, in this License were
drafted utilizing the terminology of the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary
and Artistic Works (as amended on September 28, 1979), the Rome Convention of 1961, the
WIPO Copyright Treaty of 1996, the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty of 1996 and the
Universal Copyright Convention (as revised on July 24, 1971). These rights and subject
matter take effect in the relevant jurisdiction in which the License terms are sought to be
enforced according to the corresponding provisions of the implementation of those treaty
provisions in the applicable national law. If the standard suite of rights granted under
applicable copyright law includes additional rights not granted under this License, such
additional rights are deemed to be included in the License; this License is not intended to
restrict the license of any rights under applicable law.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
51 Franklin Street, Fifth Floor, Boston, MA 02110-1301 USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL. It also counts
as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
the version number 2.1.]
Preamble
The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share and change
it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to
share and change free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially designated
software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software Foundation and other authors
who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about
whether this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better strategy to use
in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price. Our General
Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to distribute copies of
free software (and charge for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or
can get it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of it in new
free programs; and that you are informed that you can do these things.
To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to deny you
these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These restrictions translate to
certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify
it.
For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a fee, you must
give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make sure that they, too,
receive or can get the source code. If you link other code with the library, you must
provide complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them with the
library after making changes to the library and recompiling it. And you must show them
these terms so they know their rights.
We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and (2) we
offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify
the library.
To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no warranty for
the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else and passed on, the
recipients should know that what they have is not the original version, so that the
original author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be introduced by
others.
Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free program. We
wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the users of a free program by
obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder. Therefore, we insist that any patent
license obtained for a version of the library must be consistent with the full freedom of
use specified in this license.
Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU General Public
License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License, applies to certain designated
libraries, and is quite different from the ordinary General Public License. We use this
license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those libraries into non-free
programs.
When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared library, the
combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a derivative of the original
library. The ordinary General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits
more lax criteria for linking other code with the library.
We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to protect
the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also provides other free
software developers Less of an advantage over competing non-free programs. These
disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many libraries.
However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain special circumstances.
For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the widest
possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto standard. To achieve this,
non-free programs must be allowed to use the library. A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries. In this case, there is little
to gain by limiting the free library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General
Public License.
In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs enables a
greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For example, permission to
use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating system.
Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users' freedom, it
does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the Library has the freedom and
the wherewithal to run that program using a modified version of the Library.
The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow. Pay
close attention to the difference between a "work based on the library" and a "work that
uses the library". The former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter
must be combined with the library in order to run.
TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which contains a
notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party saying it may be
distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public License (also called "this
License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".
A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as to be
conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those functions and data)
to form executables.
The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been
distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the Library or
any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated straightforwardly
into another language. (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in the term
"modification".)
"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making modifications to
it. For a library, complete source code means all the source code for all modules it
contains, plus any associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control
compilation and installation of the library.
Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by this
License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the Library is not
restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a
work based on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for writing it).
Whether that is true depends on what the Library does and what the program that uses the
Library does.
1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source code as you
receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and appropriately publish on
each copy an appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the
notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a
copy of this License along with the Library.
You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at your
option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.
2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus forming a
work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications or work under the
terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating that you changed
the files and the date of any change.
c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all third parties
under the terms of this License.
d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table of data to be
supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other than as an argument passed
when the facility is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that, in the
event an application does not supply such function or table, the facility still operates,
and performs whatever part of its purpose remains meaningful.
(For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a purpose that is
entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore, Subsection 2d requires
that any application-supplied function or table used by this function must be optional: if
the application does not supply it, the square root function must still compute square
roots.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable sections of that
work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably considered independent and
separate works in themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works. But when you distribute the same
sections as part of a whole which is a work based on the Library, the distribution of the
whole must be on the terms of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to
the entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your rights to work
written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the right to control the
distribution of derivative or collective works based on the Library.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library with the Library (or
with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage or distribution medium does not
bring the other work under the scope of this License.
3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License instead of
this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must alter all the notices
that refer to this License, so that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License,
version 2, instead of to this License. (If a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary
GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you
wish.) Do not make any other change in these notices.
Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so the ordinary
GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and derivative works made from
that copy.
This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into a program
that is not a library.
4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it, under Section
2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided
that you accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used
for software interchange.
If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a designated place,
then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from the same place satisfies the
requirement to distribute the source code, even though third parties are not compelled to
copy the source along with the object code.
5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is designed to
work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called a "work that uses the
Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and therefore
falls outside the scope of this License.
However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an executable that
is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of the Library), rather than a
"work that uses the library". The executable is therefore covered by this License. Section
6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is part of the
Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of the Library even though
the source code is not. Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library. The threshold for this to
be true is not precisely defined by law.
If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts and
accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in length), then
the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a
derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the Library will
still fall under Section 6.)
Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the object code
for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables containing that work also fall
under Section 6, whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work that uses
the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library, and
distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse engineering for debugging
such modifications.
You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is used in it
and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You must supply a copy of
this License. If the work during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference directing the user to
the copy of this License. Also, you must do one of these things:
a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code for the
Library including whatever changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked with the Library, with
the complete machine-readable "work that uses the Library", as object code and/or source
code, so that the user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
executable containing the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the
contents of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the
application to use the modified definitions.)
b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A suitable
mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library already present on the
user's computer system, rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if the user installs one, as
long as the modified version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was
made with.
c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to give the
same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more than the
cost of performing this distribution.
d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a designated place,
offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials from the same place.
e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or that you have
already sent this user a copy.
For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must include any
data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from it. However, as a
special exception, the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major components (compiler,
kernel, and so on) of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that
component itself accompanies the executable.
It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of other
proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system. Such a
contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in an executable that
you distribute.
7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library side-by-side in a
single library together with other library facilities not covered by this License, and
distribute such a combined library, provided that the separate distribution of the work
based on the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise permitted, and
provided that you do these two things:
a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on the Library,
uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be distributed under the terms of
the Sections above.
b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part of it is a work
based on the Library, and explaining where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the
same work.
8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library except as
expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense,
link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your rights
under this License. However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under
this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full
compliance.
9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it. However,
nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library or its derivative
works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not accept this License. Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the Library), you indicate your
acceptance of this License to do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying,
distributing or modifying the Library or works based on it.
10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library), the
recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to copy, distribute,
link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and conditions. You may not impose
any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein. You are
not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent infringement or for
any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions are imposed on you (whether by
court order, agreement or otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they
do not excuse you from the conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to
satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all. For example,
if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by all
those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then the only way you could
satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain entirely from distribution of the
Library.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any particular
circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and the section as a whole
is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or other
property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this section has the sole
purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices. Many people have made generous contributions to
the wide range of software distributed through that system in reliance on consistent
application of that system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a consequence of
the rest of this License.
12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain countries either
by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright holder who places the
Library under this License may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation
excluding those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not
thus excluded. In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the
body of this License.
13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the Lesser
General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be similar in spirit to
the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies a version
number of this License which applies to it and "any later version", you have the option of
following the terms and conditions either of that version or of any later version published
by the Free Software Foundation. If the Library does not specify a license version number,
you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.
14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs whose
distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author to ask for
permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the
Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this. Our decision will be
guided by the two goals of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free
software and of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.
NO WARRANTY
15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY,
TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE
COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE
COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL ANY
COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS
PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL
OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING
BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY
YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN
IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use to the
public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can redistribute and change. You
can do so by permitting redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the
terms of the ordinary General Public License).

The boundary information in the TIGER/Line Shapefiles are for statistical data collection
and tabulation purposes only; their depiction and designation for statistical purposes does
not constitute a determination of jurisdictional authority or rights of ownership or
entitlement and they are not legal land descriptions.Coordinates in the TIGER/Line
shapefiles have six implied decimal places, but the positional accuracy of these
coordinates is not as great as the six decimal places suggest.
The TIGER/Line Shapefiles are an extract of selected geographic and cartographic
information from the Census MAF/TIGER database. The Census MAF/TIGER database represents a
seamless national file with no overlaps or gaps between parts. However, each TIGER/Line
Shapefile is designed to stand alone as an independent data set or the shapefiles can be
combined to cover the whole nation.
In order for others to use the information in the Census MAF/TIGER database in a
geographic information system (GIS) or for other geographic applications, the Census Bureau
releases to the public extracts of the database in the form of TIGER/Line Shapefiles.

      wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
      of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
      do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
      notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside

  implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
  of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
  PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
  appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
  risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
   liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
   incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
   result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
   Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
   work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
   other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
   has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
   and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
